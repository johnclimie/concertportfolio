When I attended this concert, I was in the 11th grade as a 17 year old. It was 6lack's first tour shortly after releasing his debut album. I was fortunate enough to meet him before the show. He put on a great first show, performing nearly every song on his new album. I enjoyed the darker aesthetic of the show that went along with the album, along with great vocal performances. The show was so high in demand that he needed to book more shows for this venue due to the location, which is where he originated from. As a bonus, he brought out YFN Lucci as a surprise guest. Sabrina Claudio also put on a great show as an opener.`,

During this show I was located about 4 or 5 rows away from the stage. It wasn't as chaotic as I expected, however that's because I was tucked away in the coroner. Regardless, I still had a great experience. The stage setup was truly special and unique, as a roller coaster hovered over the audience, as Travis would get on the ride halfway through his set. The visuals provided a great psychedelic experience. Towards the end of the show, I had the pleasure of meeting Metro Boomin, as I realized he was standing right behind me. I will never forget seeing kids drinking straight out of soda fountains at State Farm Arena right after the show due to thirst.`,

Mosh pits opened up for every song, I even lost my friend during Butterfly Effect. I lost my shoe during the show, however I somehow got it back. During Mamacita, Travis had us open up a mosh pit down the arena, that happened to be the length of the arena, which is exactly where I was. This is by far my favorite concert experience. Travis brought every special guest that represented the Atlanta trap scene for the last 10 years. This night was truly an amazing experience.`,

I got to the church and got a seat. I saw that other kids my age were there, in their Travis Scott t-shirts. After the sermon, Kanye came out and held his Sunday Service. I managed to get a good spot. I stood about 3 feet from T.I. along with 2 Chainz.

He performed a good range of his own songs, from his Post-Dubstep era, all the way up to his current Electronic R&B music. His visuals were spot on, with LED bars on the side of the stage. His show was all performed live by timing instrumentals, multiple pianos, soundboards, and an electronic drum kit, which was assisted by 2 other members on stage. His vocals sounded amazing, especially when he covered 'Godspeed' by Frank Ocean, which was written by Blake. He finished the show by covering Joni Mitchell's 'A Case of You'. He also brought out Atlanta locals JID and SwaVay to perform frozen together. His opener also brought out Lil Yachty for a guest feature, which makes it only the third time I've seen him live. Overall, it was such a great performance and I'm excited to see him again one day. No rush, James.`,

I feel as if this concert itself topped Travis Scott in chaos. There were multiple moshpits, which truly caught me surprised with how energetic they were. The show's visuals were impressive, as the stage was set up as a massive house, with a 1930's Rolls Royce that came up from the stage. A boat also traveled down the crowd onto another stage. Tyler's openers did great too, as they all had their own unique stage setup, and put on a wonderful performance. I never thought that I would mosh to Kali Uchis but I'm not complaining. Tyler mentioned that there were a few special guests in attendance, which I found out to be Westside Gunn and DJ Drama. Tyler put on a great show.`,

I spent about 6 hours at the festival before they came on stage at about 9PM. About one hour before they're set, I managed to find 2 friends from high school in the same row as me, just 10 people away. Which I found amazing, considering that over 30,000 people were in the crowd. Nine Inch Nails hit the stage at 9, and started off with Mr. Self Destruct, which was perfect. They put on an amazing performance, and closed with the song Hurt. I'm hoping they one day go on tour again if they release a new album.

The first song by Phoebe that stuck out to me was Funeral. The songwriting felt so emotional, which helped set a strong message and theme in her music. I quickly fell in love with her music, as I enjoy sad, downtempo music. I saw that she was coming to Buckhead, therefore I took the opportunity and bought tickets. This was the calmest concert I've ever been to. Her performance captured exactly what I found great about her music, emotional vulnerability. Her music is not afraid to express any sort of sad emotion. Her show ended with one of my favorite songs from her 'I Know the End', which is basically about the end of the world. This show left me excited to see what is next for her discography.`,

Once Denzel came out, it was moshpit after moshpit after moshpit. Only two songs didn't contain any mosh pits, the first song he performed and the last song. He performed a great mix of his songs, including the newest ones, and some of his older songs. The crowd was so energetic, that halfway through the show, me and a few others lost control of ourselves and nearly fell over. The floor was smeared in drinks and sweat. The show was so chaotic, I didn't get many videos or photos simply because of the fact that the crowd was so dangerous, I didn't want to risk losing my phone. After Zel's set, he came out with a surprise guest, Kenny Mason, who performed his song stick. When he came out, I was trying to figure out who it was on stage, but as I turned around, there was a moshpit that took up the entire floor, so I went ahead and just lived it out in celebration of such a good night.`,

He ran through nearly most of his new album, "It's almost dry", along with nearly most of his album before 'Daytona'. Push performed songs that went all the way back to when he was in Eclipse with his brother. The show wasn't that chaotic, other than a few songs. This was great considering that Pusha T knew all of his lyrics. He had no mistakes, and put all of his effort into this show. Sadly, there were no surprise guests, but I thought it was such a great show considering the ticket only cost $35.

He put on a really good set, as he performed a lot of his newer music and old music.
