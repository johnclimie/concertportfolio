# Concert Photo Portfolio

## Description

Over the last few years, I have found great enjoyment in attending concerts. I have been to quite a few, therefore I have created this page, a fun way to blog the photos and videos that I have taken at these concerts. The images and gifs can be viewed in an image carousel. I am very proud of the product that I have created, and I plan on updating my project as time goes on. I hope that this can inspire others to create a project like this.
